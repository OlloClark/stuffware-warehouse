				Hi there Stuffware family! We have some exciting news! With the money Mason got from his mom (Rest in Peace, Abby)
				we've decided to give the site what Erica calls "a glow up"! Thank you for your patience as we get the website
				up and running. We've hired two very nice people to do it for us, who told us they come highly recommended.

			<h4>
				Thank you Ollo and Kayla for the very clever computer hooplah you're doing for us! Can't wait to see the result!
