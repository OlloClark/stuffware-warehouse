# Stuffware Warehouse

## The website that fulfills not a single one of your needs!

Inspired by The Play That Goes Wrong, Stuffware Warehouse is a React app designed to showcase as much UI as possible, with none of it being useful.\
Some very well-meaning (and far too trusting) business owners have hired two young developers togive their website "a glow-up". The results can be described as...mixed.

### A work genuinely in progress

We're in the early stages right now, and SW is just a landing page ("several landing pages actually- we're trying to work out why, but it's probably not our falut") that redirects to Amazon.com...again, we'll work out why soon. Thanks for your patience!
